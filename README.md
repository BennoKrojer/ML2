# ML2
Part 1
- plot more curves to visualize convergence for diff batch sizes
- complete 1.4

*PART 2*
- n grams, tfidf__-use_idf (maybe hfake news has more filler words etc), penalty (not so much), c tol(vs epsilon) (possibly)
    - need to read up on and others, maybe other params we havent included? 
      - ie max_features (good to focus on high frequency vs low? ooD? etc), penalty (in solver: liblinear, etc)
- MORE GRAPHS
-> maybe try RandomSearch with all of the params (or a lot)
- maybe more preprocessing (?)
  -> remove garbage weights
-Scaling features (fromo sklearn docs)
- Pipeline (try different model with justification)
- Things to look more into: C parameter -> which > 0 pos int val for log. reg
